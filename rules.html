    <h1>Chat Rules</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our chat! Please adhere to the following rules:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>All chat must be about suspicious matches. Please do not post betting tips or predictions for normal matches.</li>
        <li>Absolutely no advertisements or spamming. This includes links to any groups and screenshots from scammer Telegram and Twitter pages.</li>
        <li>If you think a match is suspicious you must post evidence. Examples include strange betting volumes, odds movements, markets removed etc. Your friend told you and “trust me bro” are not evidence and will be deleted.</li>
        <li>If someone from the group sends you an unwarranted DM then screenshot and send it to an admin.</li>
        <li>Do not make posts regarding your bookmaker not having matches or odds available. We have a number of bookmakers that are available that you can bet with. If you need help with registering then contact an admin.</li>
        <li>Some useful websites we use are: https://betwatch.fr (https://betwatch.fr/), https://www.excapper.com (https://www.excapper.com/) .</li>
